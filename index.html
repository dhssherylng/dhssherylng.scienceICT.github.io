<h1> Our Natural Indicator </h1>
<p> Some materials & apparatus used: </p>
<ul>
<li> Red Cabbage </li>

<li> Water </li>
<li> ??? </li>

</ul>
<h2> Why? </h2>
<p> Although other fruits and vegetables can also be used, we chose to use the red cabbage as it has a deep purple colour which is clearer for observations. We used these apparatus as ??? </p>

<p> Constant variables:  </p>
<h2> Interpretation and Explanation </h2>
<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<p> The pH of our unknown substance is pH?. It is ??safe for drinking based on research, which shows that substances with pH of between 6.5 to 8.5 are safe for human consumption. Substances with pH of less than 6.5 are too acidic for consumption, while substances with pH of more than 8.5 are too alkaline. These substances with extreme pH levels may cause negative effects to our health if consumed. </p>
